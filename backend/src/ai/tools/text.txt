2. a solution could be, use an ai agent to retrieve a location from the user message, and only that,
   and hence save the location name in a variable to then pass to the main ai that will use inside
   the geocode and later the forecast

3. otherwise i'm starting to think, the 'messages' variable could be helpful somehow,

4. another thing could be to pass the user message to the prompt as i did before, maybe that could help,
   as i was thinking, how does the ai pass the user message to the forecast tool, how does he know which one is the user message
   (thinking about when i was debugging the user message inside the forecast tool)
